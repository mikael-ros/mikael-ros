# Hello 👋

My name is **Mikael; a 21 year old computer science student @ LTH, Sweden** - doing web and graphic design on the side, dabbling in mod/game development amongst many other things. I also used to do video creation, social media and streaming in the past, which have contributed to my skillset.

### 📆 Currently working on

> [!NOTE]
> I usually keep projects closed source until I'm atleast at an initial release stage. Contact me if any of the below projects sound like something you'd want to contribute to during initial development :)

📕 **Studee:** A website for my study notes, using Astro.js

⛏️ **Banana bomb:** A Minecraft mod using the Fabric API (source code coming, when finished)

↗️ **linearJ:** A Java program that aids in linear algebra calculations (solely for learning, won't be that great)

🧑‍🏫 **pythonee:** A Python beginners course (for someone special :o)

### 🗓️ Planned projects
> 🔨 Renovating my portfolio site... it's pretty old now

### 🏖️ When I'm not doing... all that, I enjoy
Cooking, exercising, gaming, reading, secondhand, and working with tech and electronics!

## Have a nice day! 🙏
