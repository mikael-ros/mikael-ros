# Hello! 👋

My name is **Mikael**. I'm a 23 year old **computer engineering student @ LTH, Lund University, Sweden**. I do web and graphic design on the side and dabble in mod/game development amongst many other things. I also used to do video creation, social media and streaming in the past.

### 🏖️ When I'm not doing... all that, I enjoy
Cooking, exercising, gaming, reading, secondhand, and working with tech and electronics!
