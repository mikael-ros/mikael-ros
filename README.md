# Hello 👋

My name is **Mikael; a 21 year old computer science student @ LTH, Sweden** - doing web and graphic design on the side, dabbling in mod/game development amongst many other things. I also used to do video creation, social media and streaming in the past, which have contributed to my skillset.

### 🏖️ When I'm not doing... all that, I enjoy
Cooking, exercising, gaming, reading, secondhand, and working with tech and electronics!
