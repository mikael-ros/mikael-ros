## Editors
### Visual Studio Code
This is the editor that I have used the most. I have decent experience using it, and have used some more advanced features like live sharing, and more.

### JetBrains
#### IntelliJ IDEA
For Java development, this has mostly been my "home", due to the excellent collaboration tools, and just tooling in general. Though, I do find it to be slightly bloated.

#### PyCharm
#### RustRover

### Neovim
I basically don't know how to use it, but I know how to save and exit!

## Basic tooling

### Git
I know how to do the basics, but I'm not a wizard.

### Linux
My main OS when doing productive things. I use arch btw, but I have also used Debian, Ubuntu and Linux Mint.

### Windows
Grew up with it, know everything a Windows poweruser could know, but I don't program in it.

## Web development

### Astro
I love this framework. I developed [Slumper](https://www.slumper.me) and [my portfolio](www.embracket.com), amongst other things, in it.

### Solid
What I use for components. Again, used in [Slumper](https://www.slumper.me) and [my portfolio](www.embracket.com).

## Graphic design

### Adobe
#### Figma
I use this to prototype my projects before designing them, and use it to make various icons.

Been using this on and off for 10 years or so. Mostly use open source alternatives these days.

#### Premiere
Know how to use this fairly proficiently.

#### After Effects

#### Illustrator

### Affinity Photo

## Game development

### Godot
Currently learning the basics.

### Unreal Engine
I have dabbled in it, but not extensively. I have made some incredibly basic games.
